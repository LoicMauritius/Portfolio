# Mon Portfolio - Mauritius Loïc

Welcome to my portfolio developed with Next.js!

## Description

This portfolio is a summary of my knowledge acquired throughout my professional and personal journey in the field of technology. It showcases my completed projects, technical skills, and provides a contact page.<br />
The goal of this portfolio is to provide a clear and interactive interface to display my projects and expertise.


## Fonctionnalités

- **Home Page**: An introduction with my skills, values, and a summary of my recent projects.
- **Project Pages**: Multiple pages displaying a list of projects I've worked on, including details such as descriptions, technologies used, key features, and images of the projects.
- **Multilingual**: The website is available in multiple languages (e.g., English and French), thanks to the integration of i18next.
